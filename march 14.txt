Today we took a practice test on java.  It was definately tough and took me a while to take a look.  The thought the second problem on business management was easy because we recieved alot of exposure to the type of problem last friday.  The third problem i was luckily able to figure out in the end.  but the first problem was difficult because I did not know the syntax for how to do a reverse string input or even recognize individual aspects of my strings...
