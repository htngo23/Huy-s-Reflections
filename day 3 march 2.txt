March 2 2016 day 3 reflection.
	Today I worked a little more on my website.  Ive completely changed it so it looks more like a restaurant page.  I mainly worked on cosmetics of the page while adding a table.  We also learned about googling methods in order to help ourselves solve problems without asking for help!
